# cv
I have created this app for MacPaw internship. Everything was done by me. I have added sound. All links are interactable. You can save CV or send it. You can call or send an e-mail. You can enlarge my photo. Also I implemented a small mini game. The rules are simple. You need to guess a word (my name). You will be presented with 8 buttons with different letters and at least 1 of which will be guaranteed correct one. After you guess the correct one all letters reshuffle and you will see new 8 letters with at least one correct.
